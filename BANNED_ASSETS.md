# Banned Mission File Assets
These objects are banned from mission files due to crashing the mission file when loaded onto the servers. 

If you would like to appeal a banned object or add a new one, Dm Cringecase.

A general rule of thumb for banned objects: If you get an error when placing it, delete the object, save your file, and restart ArmA.

## Multi-Mod (Misc)
- Any Weapons Crate with loaded objects
- Whiteboard (empty, Wall)/land_mapboard_01_wall_f
- Photoframe/land_photoframe_01_f

## Kobra
- Porg

## OPTRE
- SOEIV Human Entry Vehicle
- OPTRE Two (or more) part buildings
- land_skyhouse4

## Vanilla
- Long Rock assets. These cause frame problems when there are any considerable number of them in a mission file. Should not be used for building.
- Cargo Net (All Variants). Contains weapons that have invalid configurations and will crash a mission file on load.
- Huron Cargo Container (All Variants). Contains weapons that have invalid configurations and will crash a mission file on load.

# Notes
If you place an object and it causes an error, delete it, restart ArmA, and notify Mission Builder Leadership. Never use objects that cause errors.
