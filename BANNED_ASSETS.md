# Banned Mission File Assets
These objects are banned from mission files due to crashing the mission file when loaded onto the servers. 

If you would like to appeal a banned object or add a new one, make a new PR with your change that includes the reasoning.

A general rule of thumb for banned objects: If you get an error when placing it, delete the object, save your file, and restart ArmA.
