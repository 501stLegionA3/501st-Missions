# Banned Mission File Assets
These objects are banned from mission files due to crashing the mission file when loaded onto the servers. 

If you would like to appeal a banned object or add a new one, make a new PR with your change that includes the reasoning.

A general rule of thumb for banned objects: If you get an error when placing it, delete the object, save your file, and restart ArmA.

## Multi-Mod (Misc)
- Any Weapons Crate with loaded objects

## Kobra
- Porg

## OPTRE
- SOEIV Human Entry Vehicle
- OPTRE Two (or more) part buildings

## 3AS
- Square Landing pads. These cause problems (damage to vics, prevents uloading of patients) to razor assets.

## Vanilla
- Long Rock assets. These cause frame problems when there are any considerable number of them in a mission file. Should not be used for building.
- Cargo Net (All Variants). Contains weapons that have invalid configurations and will crash a mission file on load.
- Huron Cargo Container (All Variants). Contains weapons that have invalid configurations and will crash a mission file on load.

# Notes
If you place an object and it causes an error, delete it, restart ArmA, and notify Mission Builder Leadership. Never use objects that cause errors.
